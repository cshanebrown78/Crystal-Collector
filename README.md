# Crystal Collector Game

This was a homework assignment for my coding bootcamp class and focuses mainly on the use of jQueries and Javascript.

## Other features used

For this project I also used HTML, CSS reset, Bootstrap, and some of my own CSS.  One thing to note is I did not use jQuery to create the buttons as they were static.  I did, however, use jQuery to update information on the crystal buttons.

## How to play

* You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
* There are four crystals below.  By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
* You win the game by matching your total score to random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.
* The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it and it adds to your score.
* Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
